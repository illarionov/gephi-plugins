OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Same as Force Atlas 2 with an option for 3D.

ForceAtlas2.name=Force Atlas - 3D
ForceAtlas2.description=Same as Force Atlas 2, but with a 3D option added

ForceAtlas2.tuning=Tuning
ForceAtlas2.behavior=Behavior Alternatives
ForceAtlas2.performance=Performance
ForceAtlas2.threads=Threads

ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.name=Scaling
ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.desc=How much repulsion you want. More makes a more sparse graph.
ForceAtlas2.3D.name=3D
ForceAtlas2.3D.desc=Layout in 3D
ForceAtlas2.gravity.name=Gravity
ForceAtlas2.gravity.desc=Attracts nodes to the center. Prevents islands from drifting away.
ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.name=Stronger Gravity
ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.desc=A stronger gravity law
ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.name=Dissuade Hubs
ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.desc=Distributes attraction along outbound edges. Hubs attract less and thus are pushed to the borders.
ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.name=LinLog mode
ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.desc=Switch ForceAtlas' model from lin-lin to lin-log (tribute to Andreas Noack). Makes clusters more tight.
ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.name=Prevent Overlap
ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.desc=Use only when spatialized. Should not be used with "Approximate Repulsion"
ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.name=Tolerance (speed)
ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.desc=How much swinging you allow. Above 1 discouraged. Lower gives less speed and more precision.
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.name=Approximate Repulsion
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.desc=Barnes Hut optimization: n\u00b2 complexity to n.ln(n) ; allows larger graphs.
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.name=Approximation
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.desc=Theta of the Barnes Hut optimization.
ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.name=Edge Weight Influence
ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.desc=How much influence you give to the edges weight. 0 is "no influence" and 1 is "normal".
ForceAtlas2.threads.name=Threads number
ForceAtlas2.threads.desc=More threads means more speed if your cores can handle it.
